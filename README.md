# 🚀 Reality Simulator

**Darwinian Consciousness: Where Genetics Meet Self-Awareness**

The Reality Simulator is a multi-layered artificial life simulation that demonstrates consciousness emerging from genetic evolution. It creates a complete simulated universe where quantum particles evolve into genetically-conscious beings through natural selection, developing self-awareness, metacognition, and language learning capabilities.

## 🌀 What It Does

- **Evolves consciousness genetically** through Darwinian natural selection
- **Develops self-awareness** and metacognition (awareness of own consciousness)
- **Learns language dynamically** with AI tutoring and vocabulary evolution
- **Achieves consciousness self-reflection** - knows it's conscious and analyzes its own emergence
- **Forms complex social networks** with cooperation and competition
- **Provides live system monitoring** (quantum states, particles, CPU, RAM)
- **Interacts with humans** through multiple interface modes
- **🆕 Multi-Domain Consciousness**: Learns across quantum, temporal, social, epistemic, and mathematical domains

## 🎨 Visualizations

The simulator includes comprehensive matplotlib-based visualizations displayed in a **tabbed interface** with large, high-quality graphs:

### Enabling Visualizations
1. Set `enable_visualizations: true` in `config.json`
2. Run the simulator - a lightweight visualization viewer window will launch automatically
3. Each visualization appears in its own tab for larger, more detailed displays:
   - **Network Graph Tab**: Symbiotic network structure with organism connections
   - **Evolution Tree Tab**: Fitness evolution and generation tracking
   - **Consciousness Gauge Tab**: Real-time consciousness metrics and emergence
   - **Performance Monitor Tab**: CPU, RAM, and FPS tracking
   - **Particle Cloud Tab**: Real particle positions from the simulation

### Visualization Architecture
- **Tabbed Interface**: Each visualization has its own tab (1200x800 window) with full-size graphs
- **Large Display**: Graphs are 11x8 inches per tab for better visibility and detail
- **Lightweight Viewer**: Separate process that only displays pre-computed data (no computation)
- **Backend Optimization**: When visualizations are enabled, backend skips expensive matplotlib rendering
- **Real Data Visualization**: 
  - Network graph shows actual organism connections with dynamic layout
  - Particle cloud displays real particle positions from the simulation
  - All visualizations update from the same backend simulation instance
- **Performance**: Viewer updates every 0.5 seconds, reducing CPU usage
- **Interactive Navigation**: Each tab includes zoom, pan, and save tools via matplotlib toolbar

### Visualization Features
- **3D Network Graph**: Interactive 3D visualization of symbiotic networks with draggable rotation and zoom
- **3D Particle Cloud**: Real particle positions displayed in 3D space with position normalization and colorbar
- Real-time updates as simulation progresses
- Interactive matplotlib graphs (zoom, pan, save, etc.)
- Large fonts and labels for better readability
- Network graph layout caching (prevents jumping)
- Actual particle positions and network connections displayed
- Dark theme with high contrast for better visibility
- **Color-coded backend output**: All system components, AI responses, and debug messages are color-coded for easy identification
- **Undulating exploration behavior**: The symbiotic network now visibly “undulates” as it searches the connection space, dynamically balancing triangle-closure (clustering) vs exploration. This makes the clustering-bias feedback knob intuitive to observe in real time.
  - When clustering bias increases, the network pulls into tighter communities (more triangle closure).
  - When exploration dominates, you’ll see wave-like expansion into new regions of the space.
  - This effect is most apparent with larger organism counts (100–300+) and enabled feedback.
